# Fabric_Airbnb_Data_Engineering_Project
This project ingested Airbnb data using Microsoft Fabric Data Factory and applied the Medallion Architecture in a Fabric Lakehouse. All processing was done in Fabric using Notebooks, with a dynamic SCD Type 2 implemented in the Gold layer and a Star Schema created. Curated data was stored in the Fabric Data Warehouse.
